# ResiliSense Landing Page

ResiliSense by Vitaris is our Jumpstarter ZPIRE wellness challenge concept: a biosocial AI companion that fuses wearable biometrics, cognitive voice coaching, and social engagement insights to detect frailty early and keep Hong Kong’s older adults thriving.

This repository hosts the static landing page required for the Vibe Coding Challenge submission.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – single-page landing experience
- `styles.css` – global design system and responsive layout
- `main.js` – light interactivity (mobile nav, smooth scroll, hero chart)
- `chat.md` – documentation of AI collaboration per challenge rules

## Getting Started

### Run locally

```bash
# Option 1: use Python simple server
python -m http.server 3000

# Option 2: use Node http-server (install once globally)
npm install --global http-server
http-server -p 3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to preview the site.
